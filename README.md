# Python 

# programming

  Pragramming is nothing but instructions to a computer-----> Processor.

  * Software is just collection of multiple line of code/programme .
  
# Variables

   A variable is a memory which stores data. 

# Data types

  Data type tells data what kind of value a column or variable holds.

  * Integer -           a = 10
  * String -    " satwika"
  * List - [1,2,3]
  * Boolean - True or false
  * float - decimal value - 3.14
  * tuple  - ( 1,2,3)
  * dictionary

# Operators

   An operator is a symbol that performs an operation on one or more values (operands).

* Arithmetic Operator

   It is used to perform mathematical operations

       for example :- addition , substraction , multiplication etc.

* Assignment Operator

   It is used to assign values in variables ( and modify them)

        Example :- =, += ,-= etc.

# Data Structures in Python

   Data structures are used to store and organize data efficiently in Python.

# list

   list is mutable , it can be changed or moved.

     syntax :- list_name = [ 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 4]

# Set

  A set is an unordered, unindexed, and mutable collection of unique elements.
  
  It automatically removes duplicates and does not allow indexing or slicing.

     Syntax :- set_name = { element1, element2, element3, ......}

  * Set Removes Duplicates Automatically

# Dictionaries 

   A Dictionary is an unordered, mutable collection of key–value pairs.
   
   Each key must be unique, and values can be of any data type.

   Syntax of Dictionary

           dictionary_name = {
           key1: value1,
           key2: value2,
           key3: value3,
          ...
          }

 # Functions 

   A function is a block of reusable code that is used to perform a specific task.

      def function_name (parameters)
      statement()
      return value

#  Modules and Packages: Organizing code into modules and packages. 

# Module 

  A module in Python is simply a file that contains Python code — functions, classes, or variables — which can be imported and used in another Python program.

  <img width="425" height="87" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ce93ee1-f6c8-41fb-8801-d349bdf02130" />

#  Package

   A package is a collection of modules stored in a directory that contains a special file called __init__.py.

syntax:

      my packages/
          __init___.py
          math.py
          main.py

# File Handling:

  File handling allows you to create, read, write, and modify files in Python.
 
  It is useful for storing and retrieving data from text files, log or external data sources.

  syntax :

         file = ("filename", "mode")

# OOPS - ( Object oriented Programming)

  OOPs means Object-Oriented Programming System.

  It is a way of writing programs using objects — just like how we see things in the real world.

# Main Concepts of OOP

* Class

   A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.

   It defines functions and variables that the object created from the class.

        class classname:

  <img width="443" height="170" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bf7b54c-9179-4cbc-82e5-02038ce48056" />

* Object

   An object is an instance (copy) of a class.
  
It is created from a class blueprint and contains its own data and behavior.

    Object_name = Classname

<img width="438" height="188" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb4e42a7-53b9-4aae-983c-a26936ec19aa" />

* What is __init__() in Python?

   When you create an object, the __init__() method sets up the object — it initializes the object’s data (variables).

   The __init__() method is a special method (also called a constructor) in Python classes.
  
* Why We Use __init__()

    To initialize variables
     Automatic Execution
    To avoid repetitive code
    To make object ready to use

   Whenever your class needs to store data like name, age, color, etc., for each object.

# Inheritance:

   It allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class).

  * Single inheritance
  * Multilevel inheritance
  * Hierararichal inheritance
  * Multiple inheritance

* Single Inheritance:

    A child class inherits from only one parent class

  * We Use Single Inheritance for 
 
     Code Reusability
     Simplicity
     Logical Relationship
     Extend Functionality

         class Parent:
        def parent_method(self):
        print("This is the parent class")

        class Child(Parent):

        def child_method(self):
        print("This is the child class")

        obj = Child()

        obj.parent_method()
        obj.child_method()
